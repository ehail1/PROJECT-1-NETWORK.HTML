<H1>WHAT'S NETWORK</H1>
<p> A computer network is a set of computers connected together for the purpose of sharing resources. The most common resource shared today is connection to the Internet. Other shared resources can include a printer or a file server. The Internet itself can be considered a computer network.</p> <img src="https://previews.123rf.com/images/hywards/hywards1502/hywards150200073/36609883-computer-network.jpg" alt="conected computers" >   
  <h2>What makes network and how does it work</H2>
  <P>To make a network, you need nodes and connections (sometimes called links) between them. Linking up the nodes means making some sort of a temporary or permanent connection between them. In the last decade or so, wireless connections have become one of the most popular ways of doing this, especially in homes. In offices, wired connections are still more commonplaceâ€”not least because they are generally faster and more secure and because many newer offices have network cabling already in place.
